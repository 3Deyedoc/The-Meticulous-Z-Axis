Included are drawing files (dxf and svg) as well as nc files. The drawing files are provided for you to generate your own g-code. The nc files are broken out into each tool, and there is also a version that has all the tools together (with tool changes). 

All plywood components (included in "PrototypeSled") are designed for 18mm plywood. The "DustWindow" part is designed for 1/8" plexiglass.

Programs are:

* All (All toolpaths with tool changes)

* 0125in-2FL (1/8" 2 flute upshear bit)

* 0250in-1Fl (1/4" 1 flute upshear bit)

* Drill (1/8" drill bit)

* Engrave (Engraving bit of your choice)

Also included are the stl files for the 3D printed parts. I have included a variety of hose adaptors, but if I have missed the one you have, pm me (meticulousmaynard) on the Maslow forums and I'll make one up for you.

I have yet to test all these programs, I don't believe there will be any issues with them however. But do keep an eye out for any issues that might arise (feed rates, errors, and machine issues)
